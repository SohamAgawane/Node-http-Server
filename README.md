# Node.js HTTP Server

This project is a simple Node.js HTTP server that handles basic routing and logs incoming requests to a file. It demonstrates using the http and fs modules in Node.js to handle HTTP requests and perform file operations.

Features : 
Handles requests to the root (/) and the /about route.
Logs each incoming request with a timestamp to a file named log.txt.
Provides basic responses for defined routes and a 404 Not Found for undefined routes.
